App Description: With the constant issues that continously arise in the world, many people begin to not realize one of the bigger issues in the world, climate change. Our project tackles climate change head on to spread awareness on statistics, articles, and solutions. Implementation for the user will be added to redirect users to organizations, patreons, etc. on helping out. There will be formats and ways that will tell the user how to prevent climate change, examples being using less water, recycling often, and many more. Together, we can prevent our precious Earth from being damaged more, and instead, grow it back to the amazing environment it was before.
